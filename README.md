# How will you gather test data? (20 points)
[Tell us what you'll try to sense (e.g., how much sun certain rooms get, how loud study rooms tend to be, how loud is your house, where's the best place to put your tomatoe plant, etc)]
We will gather raw audio data in different home settings.  What we do with this data will be dependent on the quality and sample rate, but some ideas we have are examining volume in different houses, fourier analysis to determine dominant pitch in various settings, or identifying who is home by the audio data.  Obviously these ideas need to be refined and delved into a bit more.
