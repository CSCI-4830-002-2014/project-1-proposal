Sounds

# Any prior experience? (10 points)
I have used an Arduino to create some light displays with and without sensors. The hardest thing I have made is a row of LED's which light up linearly using [Charlieplexing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlieplexing).

I am also a CE minor, so I have done Verilog programming for the DE0 board in Digital Logic.

# Have you soldered before? (5 points)
Yes

# How will you gather test data? (20 points)
I would love to do a party comparison. Throw one party at my house and another at a group mate's house and perform analytics on the sound recorded. We could begin with simple volume comparisons, but optimally, I would like to compare the pitch of the tones using Fourier transforms. We could determine if there are lower or higher tones present at the parties. Optimally, we would then determine who's party had more ladies versus who's was just a bro hangout.
