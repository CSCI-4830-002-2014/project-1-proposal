# Any prior experience? (10 points)

# Have you soldered before? (5 points)

No.

# How will you gather test data? (20 points)

I am going to try to map traffic patterns by collecting sound data off 30th St. Barring that, I will map traffic patterns in the UMC by taking sound data to see when classes start and begin, and what the peak hours are in the UMC. I will have to use the Arduino for at least 4-5 hours to get data.

# Which workshop will you attend? (5 points)

Tuesday.
