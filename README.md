# Any prior experience? (10 points)
I have experience simulating UEI DAQ analog and serial card behavior. I'm not sure how relevant this experience is though.

No.

# How will you gather test data? (20 points)
I'd like to play a musical piece from a piano or speaker (for less variance) and compare the inputted data from various locations in the room/concert hall to potentially identify the "best" seat from which to listen to a concert.
