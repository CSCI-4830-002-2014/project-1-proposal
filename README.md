# Any prior experience? (10 points)
I have used an Arduino to create some light displays. The hardest thing I have made is a row of LED's which light up linearly using [Charlieplexing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlieplexing).

# Have you soldered before? (5 points)
Yes

# How will you gather test data? (20 points)
I would love to do a party comparison. Throw one party at my house and another at a group mate's house and perform analytics on the sound recorded. We could begin with simple volume comparisons, but optimally, I would like to compare the pitch of the tones. So we could determine if there are lower or higher tones present at the parties. Optimally, this could be used to determine who's party had more ladies versus who's was just a bro hangout.
