# Name
Sam Korn

# Sensor Type (10 points)
DHT22: Temperature and Humidity Sensor

# Any prior experience? (10 points)
I have prior experience programming for Arduino and for the Raspberry Pi. I have experience making custom PCBs that can work alongside these development environments in order to make more consistent results than breadboard/stripboard projects.

# Have you soldered before? (5 points)
Yes

# How will you gather test data? (20 points)
I will try to sense the temperature and humidity outside of my house for a day. This will allow me to see if changes in temperature have an affect on humidity and vice-versa. In addition I can compare my feeling of the weather for the day with the actual results from the sensor. 

# Which workshop will you attend? (5 points)
I did not attend a workshop, but I talked with you about it already and I have enough prior experience with these development environments to not need to go to one.
