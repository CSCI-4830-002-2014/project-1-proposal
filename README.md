# Name
Marc Simpson

# Sensor Type (10 points)
Sound Sensor

# Any prior experience? (10 points)
I have used arduino, however, it was on a very basic level. I did a small project for my freshman engineering projects class. Other than that I have no other experience with arduino and how I would go about working on this project.

# Have you soldered before? (5 points)
yes

# How will you gather test data? (20 points)
I will be gathering my data from the noise my fraternity house produces. I will put the sound sensor on the first floor and figure out what time of the day or what day of the week is the most quiet for study purposes. Or maybe when the best time to take a nap would be as well.

# Which workshop will you attend? (5 points)
I did not attend a workshop because this project is exceptionally late. So i will work with Michael on Monday, September 15th to work on my arduino set.
