# Name
Niklas Fejes

# Sensor Type (10 points)
Sound Sensor

# Any prior experience? (10 points)
I have taken a course in Microcontroller programming (grad level, corresponding to 6 credits) where we programmed AVRs and learned about the hardware features of Atmel's microcontrollers. I am familiar with the Arduino environment but prefer to code in plain C/C++.

# Have you soldered before? (5 points)
yes

# How will you gather test data? (20 points)
I will try to sense the loudness from the street outside my window to detect when it is better to study at home vs in school. Compared to the light sensor, the sound sensor allows for more complex analysis of the data on hardware. I will try to detect more than just loudness for the test data.

# Which workshop will you attend? (5 points)
Tuesday 2:30-4:30
