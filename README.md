# Sensor Type (10 points)
Sound Sensor sounds like fun. 

# Any prior experience? (10 points)
NA. I made a digital clock in Circuts I, but that was a few years ago and not really the same sort of thing (no microprossesor, for example)

# Have you soldered before? (5 points)
yes... but I could use a refresher. 

# How will you gather test data? (20 points)
I thought it would be fun to play some ukulele/guitar songs and compare it to professional or other players to compare the difference. Maybe do averaging of certain notes to see the pattern for an "ideal" G for example. Just a thought. 

# Which workshop will you attend? (5 points)
Tuesday 2:30-4:30
